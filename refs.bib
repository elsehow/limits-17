abstract = {To explain the uncanny holding power that some technologies seem to have, this paper presents a theory of charisma as attached to technology. It uses the One Laptop per Child project as a case study for exploring the features, benefits, and pitfalls of charisma. It then contextualizes OLPC's charismatic power in the historical arc of other charismatic technologies, highlighting the enduring nature of charisma and the common themes on which the charisma of a century of technological progress rests. In closing, it discusses how scholars and practitioners in human-computer interaction might use the concept of charismatic technology in their own work.},

abstract = {The majority of the world's computing power is no longer in su- percomputer centers and institutional machine rooms. Instead, it is now distributed in the hundreds of millions of personal computers all over the world. In a few more years, other consumer devices like game consoles and television set-top boxes may comprise a large fraction of total computing power. This change is critical to scientists whose research requires extreme computing power. Projects like SETI@home and Folding@home have attracted millions of participants who donate time on their home PCs to a scientific effort. Work is underway to create similar projects in many other areas, enabling scientific explorations that were previously infeasible. The implications of this ”public computing” paradigm are social as well as scientific. It provides a basis for global communities centered around common interests and goals. It creates incentives for the public to learn about current scientific research. Ultimately, it will give the public more direct control over the directions of science progress.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Although human lives towards the second half of the twentieth century became increasingly mediated by objects and artifacts and have depended heavily on the functioning of technical systems, materiality in a broad sense became relatively marginalized as a topic of research interest. This volume contributes to redressing the balance by drawing together the work of scholars involved in exploring the sociomaterial dimensions of organizational life. It will look at the way material objects and artifacts are conceived in organizations, and how they function in interaction with human agents. The book offers a new conceptual repertoire and vocabulary that allows deeper thought and discussion about the inherent entanglement of the social and material. Like the preceding volumes in the Perspectives on Process Organization Studies series, the book displays the richness that characterizes process thinking, and combines philosophical reflections with novel conceptual perspectives and insightful empirical analyses.},

Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African countries--Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda--we show how a convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can explain up to 75{\%} of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.},

abstract = {The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, we present a novel direction in the cryptanalysis of the cryptographic hash function SHA-1. Our work builds on previous cryptanalytic efforts on SHA-1 based on combinations of local collisions. Due to dependencies, previous approaches used heuristic corrections when combining the success probabilities and message conditions of the individual local collisions. Although this leads to success probabilities that are seemingly sufficient for feasible collision attacks, this approach most often does not lead to the maximum success probability possible as desired. We introduce novel techniques that enable us to determine the theoretical maximum success probability for a given set of (dependent) local collisions, as well as the smallest set of message conditions that attains this probability. We apply our new techniques and present an implemented open-source near-collision attack on SHA-1 with a complexity equivalent to 257.5 SHA-1 compressions. Secondly, we present an identical-prefix collision attack and a chosen-prefix collision attack on SHA-1 with complexities equivalent to approximately 261 and 277.1 SHA-1 compressions, respectively.},

@unpublished{Stevens2017,
abstract = {SHA-1isawidelyused1995NISTcryptographichashfunctionstandardthatwas officially deprecated by NIST in 2011 due to fundamental security weaknesses demonstrated in various analyses and theoretical attacks. Despite its deprecation, SHA-1 remains widely used in 2017 for document and TLS certificate signatures, and also in many software such as the GIT versioning system for integrity and backup purposes. A key reason behind the reluctance of many industry players to replace SHA-1 with a safer alternative is the fact that finding an actual collision has seemed to be impractical for the past eleven years due to the high complexity and computational cost of the attack. In this paper, we demonstrate that SHA-1 collision attacks have finally become practical by providing the first known instance of a collision. Furthermore, the prefix of the colliding messages was carefully chosen so that they allow an attacker to forge two PDF documents with the same SHA-1 hash yet that display arbitrarily-chosen distinct visual contents. We were able to find this collision by combining many special cryptanalytic techniques in complex ways and improving upon previous work. In total the computational effort spent is equivalent to 263.1 SHA-1 compressions and took approximately 6 500 CPU years and 100 GPU years. As a result while the computational power spent on this collision is larger than other public cryptanalytic computations, it is still more than 100 000 times faster than a brute force search.},
